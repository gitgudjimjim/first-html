Practice: write a dog class
props: name, breed, (anything else you want)
methods: bark (anything else you want)


class Dog{
    constructor(breed, age, color){
        this.breed = breed;
        this.age = age;
        this.color = color;
    }
    // Method to make the dog jump
    jump (){
        // Make it jump in some way
    }
    bark (){
        // Make it bark
    }
    maul (){
        // make it maul someone
    }
}
